# Maze Solver Project

Welcome to my **Maze Solver Project**! This project involves solving mazes using various pathfinding algorithms. It includes visualization of the maze-solving process and can be extended with additional features and algorithms.

## Features

- **Depth-first search (DFS)** maze-solving algorithm.
- **Visualization** of the maze and solution path.
- **Configurable** maze size and solver speed.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deedee-ke/maze_solver.git
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the Maze Solver:

```bash
python maze_solver.py
```

This will launch the solver and begin the maze-solving visualization.

## Usage

After running the project, you can:

- Watch the algorithm solve a randomly generated maze.
- Adjust the maze size or solver speed if supported (modify the script as needed).
- Explore different mazes by restarting the script.
